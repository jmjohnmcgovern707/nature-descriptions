An electron has mass.
An electron is either positive or negative.
if an electron is negative is is drawn with the arrows pointing toward it.
if an electron is positive is is drawn with arrows pointing away from it.
if a voltage is applied to a conductor the negative electrons flow to the positive electrons.
1 columb of electrons is 6.242 x 10^18 electrons.
1 joule of energy is equal to 1 Coulumb x 1 Volt
The word joule came from English physicist James Prescott Joule.
Electrons flow through conductors.
Flowing electrons through a conductor are called free electrons.
Free electrons are electrons that have been freed from their atoms.
An electron is originally in the atom. For example they hydrogen atom contains 1 electron.
The electron has a spin too.
