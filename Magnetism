Faraday did an experiment that showed that a magnetic field produces current flow if 
a conductor is sufficiently near it. A device called a galvanometer was used by Faraday
to measure the small current flow. Notice that if enough current flows it would light
a light bulb and the light bulb could replace the galvanometer.

The magnetic field produced by a magnet can be either positive or negative and it is
analygous with an electric field. positive repels positive. negative repels negative.
positive and negative attract.

The magnetic field lines flow around the magnet
