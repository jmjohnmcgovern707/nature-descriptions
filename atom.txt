The atom has a radius. It is called the Bohr radius. This was
discovered by Niels Bohr.
The atom has protons and electrons. The hydrogen atom has one
electron and one proton. The proton is at the center of the atom.
The electron is not orbiting around the proton like they had originally
thought. The electron is at an energy level somewhere in the hot air
balloon on one side of the proton and it is spinning with a value
of +1 or -1 and identified as j.
An atom is called an ion if the number of electrons is not equal to the
number of protons. for example, if an atom looses an electron, then the
atom is called a positive ion. If an atom gains an electron, then it is
called a negative ion.
