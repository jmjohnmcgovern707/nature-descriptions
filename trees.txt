trees in a fire produce ash,water vapor and carbon dioxide. carbon dioxide is 1 carbon atom with 2 hydrogen atoms bonded to it.
the heat, carbon and oxygen in the air allows the fire to continue to burn once it is started. IF YOU REMOVE ANY ONE OF THESE 
ELEMENTS,heat,carbon or oxygen, THE FIRE WILL GO OUT!

trees are mostly made of carbon. water comes from the ground through the tree and out the leafs. photosynthesis is the process in 
the clorofyll that causes the release of oxygen into the air when sunlight and carbon dioxide interact with it. This provides breathing
oxygen for creatures that require oxygen for breath.

leafs of trees are green because the clorofyll reflects the green photons from the sun. The run and blue photons are obsorbed by the clorofyll. this is 
why the leafs are green. I guess this is why plant leafs are green too.
